# blackJack
A card game made with Javascript. Users have an initial balance and can choose bet amount via three buttons that trigger card auto-selection.

Game has one error to be fixed:

The hold function is resulting in several check winner functions resulting in game being drawn as well as player/dealer winning (as evident by multiple sound effects), messing up the balance updates as well as showing that the game is drawn when it's not.
